## 🎨 Console-Shader
 
 A simple ASCII animation system for the console, powered by shader-like functions.
 
### 💡 What’s a Fragment Shader?
 
 In graphics programming, a fragment shader runs once for every pixel (or “fragment”) on the screen.
 In this project, it’s a function that runs once for each character position in the console grid to determine what to draw.
 

### 🔄 Changing Shaders
 
 1. Open main.cpp
 2. In the render function, change ...shaders::circle to any of the functions found in the shaders folder or your custom shader.
  
### 🛠️ How to Compile
 
 1. Open your terminal.
  
 2. Navigate to the src directory.
  
 3. Run: 
	 make 

 
### ✨ Final Note 
 Go make some awesome shaders — ASCII style! 😎
